NOTES:
    The 3D Visualizer is only supported on 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04, and it will not work on the cmput274 virtual disk.
    If you are running from a VM, make sure 3D Acceleration is enabled, and enough processing power + memory is allocated, as this is a fairly demanding program.

Running Instructions:
    1. Download Qt 5.12.2 from the link below (1.4GB)
	download.qt.io/official_releases/qt/5.12/5.12.2/qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.2.run

    2. Navigate to your "home/opt" directory, open a terminal here and type the command:
	sudo mkdir Qt

    3. Open a terminal in the directory which you donwloaded the .run file, and type the following commands:
	$ chmod +x qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.2.run
	$ ./qt-opensource-linux-x64-5.12.2.run

    3. An installer will pop up. Click:
	Next
	Skip
	Next
    
    4. When asked to specify the directory where Qt 5.12.2 will be installed, browse to the "home/opt/Qt" directory you created in step 2. Click "Next".

    5. Make sure Qt 5.12.2 is checked under components you want to install. Click "Next".

    6. Select "I have read and agree to the terms contained in the license agreements" and click "Next" to continue. Finally, press "Install" to begin the installation process (~5GB)

    7. When the installation is finished, start Qt, and navigate to Welcome->Projects->Open Project

    8. From here, you want to navigate into the project submission directory, into 3DVisualizer->GraphRenderer->Graphs.pro

    9. If a pop-up window appears, press "Ok", then "Configure"

    10. Now, within the 3DVisualizer directory, navigate to the "FileDecoder" folder, and install the required dependencies found in that directory.

    11. Once you have done that, open a terminal from within the "FileDecoder" directory and type the following commands:
	$ make
	$ ./test [chooseanymp3file.mp3]
    to calculate the magnitude-frequency-time data and output it to a text file "output.txt"

    12. Finally, moving back to the Qt IDE, right-click on the "Graphs" project and click run
	
    13. Once, the program has loaded (it may take a minute), right click+hold+move the mouse around to move the camera.
	"Animation Mode" will render the graph data over time. Adjust the "Buffer Length" slider to get a moving 3D rendering of the data. Speed can also be modified using the "Animate Speed" slider.
	"Build Mode" will render from the beginning of the data, and build the rest of the graph data from there. Speed can also be modified using the "Build Speed" slider.
	"Static Mode" simply renders the entire 3D graph in a static form.
